Inspired by [this][mat2vec] cool paper, I wanted to analyze the metadata of a bunch of scientific journal articles.
By [some][50million] [estimates][2.5millionperyear] there are at least 75 million published journal articles, so I figured I'd start small and only use papers published on [arXiv][arxiv].
It turns out that someone already published a [handy tool][metha] called *metha* for downloading bulk Open Archives Initiative metadata.

After downloading and configuring metha, I ran the bash command:
{% highlight shell_session %}
metha-sync http://export.arxiv.org/oai2 --format arXiv
{% endhighlight %}
which downloaded the metadata for every arXiv article in XML format.
It took a few hours, but in the end I had more then 3 GB of XMl files.
These files contained entries of the form:

{% highlight xml %}
 <oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd">
 <dc:title>Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ovchinnikov, Sergei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph
defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play
an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed
in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary
dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known
results are given.
  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and
contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes
from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite
partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.

I wrote a script you can see on my [GitHub][sqlite-script] to loop over records in all files and parse the entries for each field, and store the data in a SQLite3 database.
The fields I extracted were article title, abstract, authors, subjects, unique arXiv identifier, and date.
The parsing was done using BeautifulSoup and regular expressions, for example, this function created a semicolon-delimited list of all subject keywords of a given journal article:

{% highlight python %}
regex = re.compile(r'^[^0-9]+$')
def get_subjects( record ):

  fa = record.find_all('dc:subject')
  l = [ a.text for a in fa ]
  l = list(filter(regex.search, l))

  return ';'.join(l)
{% endhighlight %}

For convenience (assuming your computer has enough RAM), we can convert the SQLite3 database into a Pandas DataFrame.
It's also useful for analysis purposes to separate the fields and subfields of each article.
We can do both of these steps using [this script][dataframe-script].

Finally, we can do some data analysis.
We use [this script][plot-script] to generate plots of field prominence over time for the top 6 fields:

Interesting! There's been a lot of changes in the popularity of fields in the last 25 or so years. It seems that arXiv was primarily a High Energy Physics journal in the 1990s, but that field's preeminence has since gradually declined since then.
Pure mathematics increased to a high of about 1/4 around 2015 but has declined slightly since then.
The big winner seems to be computer science, which has grown significantly in popularity, especially since around 2005.

Let's take a look at the most popular subfield for each of the top 6 fields:

A few preliminary points are worth mentioning: some fields (*Mathematics*, *Computer Science*, and *Physics* in particular) did not have many papers in the early years, so the data from that period is not necessarily representative.
Additionally, it seems that the *Astrophysics* section changed their classification system around 2008: before that all papers had the subject *"Astrophysics"*, with no subfield, but after that they started including subfields. And due to the way I extracted the field and subfield names, fields without a subfield have the default subfield name of an empty string, which is why the prominent curve in the *Astrophysics* plot has no label in the legend.

* For *Mathematics*, *PDE Analysis* and *Combinatorics* are hot, *Differential Geometry* is not.
* For *Condensed Matter*, *Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics*, and *Materials Science* are hot, *Statistical Mechanics* is not.
* For *High Energy Physics*, *Experiment* is hot (probably due in large part to the LHC), but most of the other subfields are fairly constant. I'm not sure about the source of the periodic pattern in the *Theory* and *Lattice* subfields.
* For *Astrophysics*, *Astrophysics of Galaxies* is hot, *Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics* is not.
* For *Computer Science*, it's no surprise that *Machine Learning* and *Computer Vision* are hot, and *Information Theory* is not.
* Finally, for *Physics*, *Optics* is hot, and ignoring the outliers in the 1990s, most of the other subfields are fairly constant.

Using the [Google Charts Service][google-charts], I created an interactive Sankey diagram for the 40 most common subjects on arXiv.
I found that using more than 40 or so subjects made the chart look terrible due to the large number of subfields.

If you'd like a copy of the database I generated but for some reason can't run the scripts in the [GitHub Repo][github-repo], send me an email and I'll get it to you.
